# Module 3 Quiz:

1. You are given a dataset on movie reviews with a 1,000 labeled reviews. The labels are one of five movie genres: Action, Comedy, Drama,    Horror, and Sci-Fi. The dataset has roughly 200 movie reviews for each movie genre. 

   **Your first task** is to learn a supervised classifier to identify just the reviews for Comedy movies from the dataset. Such a task      is:
   - [x] Two-class (Binary) classification

2. The dataset available for the first task is:
   - [x] Skewed

3. Suppose you decide to train a support vector machine classifier for this first task. The methodology you will employ will be a:
   - [x] C. Single binary classifier

4. You are given a dataset on movie reviews with a 1,000 labeled reviews. The labels are one of five movie genres: Action, Comedy, Drama,    Horror, and Sci-Fi. The dataset has roughly 200 movie reviews for each movie genre.

   **Your second task** is to learn to identify all five movie genres. Such a task is:
   - [x] Multi-class classification

5. The dataset available for the second task is:
   - [x] Balanced

6. Suppose you decide to train a support vector machine classifier for the second task. The methodology you will employ will be a:
   - [ ] A. One vs One classifier
   - [ ] B. One vs Rest classifier
   - [ ] C. Single five-class classifier
   - [x] Either A or B
   - [ ] Classifier cannot be trained
   
7. How many binary classifiers will you need to train for the second task using the one-vs-one classification approach?
   - [x] 10
